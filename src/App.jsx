                Do you remember In the first year when we started talking?
                It was such a great time for me. I still recall our first
                meeting at the ICH for your sih doubt, and then our trip to
                Bhedaghat‚Äîit was amazing, but ik mere friends ke karn awkward ho
                gya tha.
                <br />
                 Mene socha tha now I got a good friend, but when I saw
                you with that senior, mujhe bura lga tha. But now, as we're
                talking again and jb m Bangalore ja rha tha us time bhi tum
                mujhse milne aae thi, even you also called me there, I realize I
                can't keep these feelings to myself any longer.
                <br />
                 I don't want to live with regrets, so I'm laying it all out‚ÄîI have feelings for
                you, more than just as a friend. You've been such an incredible
                presence in my life. 
                Regardless of how you feel about what I said, I want you to know that I value our friendship more than anything.
                <br />
