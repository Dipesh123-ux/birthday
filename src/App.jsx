Mene socha tha now I got a good friend, but when I saw you with that senior, mujhe bura lga tha. But now, as we're talking again and jb m Bangalore ja rha tha us time bhi tum mujhse milne aae thi, even you also called me there, I realize I can't keep these feelings to myself any longer.
I don't want to live with regrets, so I'm laying it all out‚ÄîI have feelings for you, more than just as a friend. You've been such an incredible presence in my life. Mujhe tumhara response nhi janna bcz it's too late now  but you are the best junior and friend I ever had ü§çü´∂.</div>
